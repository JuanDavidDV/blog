# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

user = User.where(email: "test@email.com").first_or_initialize # If user does not exist it will create a new one
user.update!( # ! enforces sdtricter error handling
  password: "password",
  password_confirmation: "password"
)

# 100.times do |i|
#  BlogPost.create title: "Blog Post #{i}", content: "Hello world", published_at: Time.current
# end
